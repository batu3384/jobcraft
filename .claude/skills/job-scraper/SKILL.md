# Job Scraper

---

## How It Works

This skill searches job portals using the **installed portal-search CLIs** in
`.agents/skills/` (plus WebSearch as a fallback), using queries from your profile.
It deduplicates against previously seen jobs and the application tracker, and
presents new matches with a quick fit assessment.

## Invocation

The user triggers this skill by saying things like:
- "Find new jobs"
- "Scrape for jobs"
- "Any new positions?"
- "/scrape"

Optional arguments:
- A focus area, e.g. "/scrape data science" or "/scrape software engineering"
- "broad" to run all search categories, e.g. "/scrape broad"

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Load State

1. Read `job_scraper/seen_jobs.json` (create from `job_scraper/seen_jobs.example.json` if missing — `./install.sh` does this automatically)
2. Read `job_search_tracker.csv` to extract already-applied companies+roles
3. Read `search-queries.md` (this directory) for the search strategy

### Step 1: Search

Read `search-queries.md` (this directory) for the search strategy. By default, run the top 3 priority query categories. If the user said "broad", run all categories. If the user specified a focus area (e.g. "data science"), prioritize queries from that category.

**Use the installed CLI tools as the primary search mechanism.** Fall back to `WebSearch` only for portals that do not have a CLI skill, or if `bun` is unavailable on the system.

#### 1a. Check bun availability

```bash
bun --version
```

If this fails (bun not installed), skip to **1c (WebSearch fallback)** for all portals and note the fallback in the Step 5 output.

**Yenibiriş preflight (before CLI calls):** If `yenibiris-search` is enabled, check that `YENIBIRIS_COOKIE` or `JOBCRAFT_HTTP_COOKIE` is set (agent shell: `source scripts/jobcraft-env.sh`). If missing, **do not** call the Yenibiriş CLI — log once: “Yenibiriş skipped — run `./scripts/setup-portal-auth.sh` (see `docs/portal-authentication.md`)” and continue other portals.

#### 1b. Run CLI tools (primary — run these in parallel where possible)

Discover all installed portal CLI skills by reading every `SKILL.md` found under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Each file documents that portal's exact CLI flags and usage examples. **Use each portal's own documented interface — do not guess flags.** This approach automatically includes any new portals added via `/add-portal` without requiring changes to this file.

**Honor the `enabled` toggle.** A portal is enabled unless its `SKILL.md` frontmatter sets `enabled: false` (a missing key means enabled — the default). Skip each disabled portal and record it for the Step 5 summary. A fork can thus keep a portal installed but sit out a run without deleting its directory.

For each **enabled** portal skill:

1. Read its `SKILL.md` to find the correct `bun run …` invocation and supported flags.
2. Translate the query terms from `search-queries.md` into that portal's flag format (e.g. `--key`, `--search-string`, `--query`, filter codes — whatever the portal's SKILL.md specifies).
3. Scope to the last 14 days **only when the portal documents a recency flag** (`--jobage`, `--since`, etc.). If the portal has no recency flag (e.g. `kariyer-net-search`), skip that constraint and note it — do not invent flags.
4. Cap results to ~20 per call using the portal's limit flag.
5. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output.

Run all portal CLI calls in parallel where possible using the Agent tool. Collect all `results` arrays into a single pool for Step 2, keeping each result tagged with its source portal skill (for Step 2 `detail` lookups).

If a CLI tool exits with a non-zero code, read stderr JSON when present. If `code` is `CLOUDFLARE_BLOCKED` or `EMPTY_BLOCKED`, mark that portal unavailable, use **one** WebSearch fallback for it (Step 1c), and do **not** retry-hammer the CLI. For other errors, log and continue — do not abort the whole search.

If a CLI exits **0** but `meta.count === 0` or `results` is empty, treat that portal as thin/empty for this query: run Step 1c WebSearch once for that portal's `site:` templates, then continue.

#### 1b-recovery. Block recovery algorithm (mandatory when any portal fails)

When a portal is blocked, empty, or disabled, recover coverage in this **fixed order** — do not invent postings:

```
FOR each failed_or_empty portal P:
  1. If stderr code is CLOUDFLARE_BLOCKED or EMPTY_BLOCKED:
       - Log once: "P unavailable (code)"
       - If P is yenibiris-search: tell the user to run `./scripts/setup-portal-auth.sh` (see `docs/portal-authentication.md`) — do not ask for cookies in chat
       - Do NOT retry the CLI in a loop
  2. WebSearch once using search-queries.md site: template for P
  3. Merge WebSearch/WebFetch hits into the result pool (tag source = P + websearch)
  4. Continue other portals — one portal failure never aborts /scrape
```

Coverage priority when building the final shortlist (prefer earlier sources if duplicates):

1. kariyer-net-search  
2. yenibiris-search (cookie: `./scripts/setup-portal-auth.sh` — see `docs/portal-authentication.md`)  
3. eleman-net-search  
4. linkedin-search  
5. WebSearch for any thin portal  

#### 1c. WebSearch fallback

Use `WebSearch` for:
- Portals listed in `search-queries.md` that do **not** have a corresponding directory under `.agents/skills/`
- Any portal whose CLI fails at runtime (including `CLOUDFLARE_BLOCKED` / `EMPTY_BLOCKED`)
- Any enabled portal that returned **zero** results for the query
- When bun is unavailable (Step 1a failed)

Use the site-specific query strings from `search-queries.md` directly as WebSearch queries for these portals.

### Step 2: Fetch & Parse

For each promising result from Step 1:

**From CLI results:** Search output already includes title, company, location, date,
and URL. For jobs worth a deeper look, fetch full detail with that portal's `detail`
command (see its SKILL.md — do not guess flags) to extract **key requirements**,
**application deadline**, and a brief description snippet.

**From WebSearch results:** Use `WebFetch` on the posting URL and extract the same
fields manually.

For every candidate:
- Skip if the URL or company+title combo already exists in `seen_jobs.json`
- Skip if the company+role already appears in `job_search_tracker.csv`

### Step 3: Quick Fit Assessment

For each new job, do a rapid fit check (NOT the full evaluation from `04-job-evaluation.md` - just a quick signal):

- **High match**: Role directly involves your core skills
- **Medium match**: Role is adjacent to your experience
- **Low match**: Role requires significant skills you lack

### Step 4: Deduplicate & Store

1. Add ALL fetched jobs (new and skipped) to `seen_jobs.json` with structure:
```json
{
  "seen": {
    "<url_or_company_title_key>": {
      "title": "...",
      "company": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "first_seen": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "fit": "high/medium/low",
      "status": "new/skipped/evaluated/ranked/expired"
    }
  }
}
```

`/rank` extends this schema additively: ranked entries also carry `rank_score` (0–100 overall score), `rank_verdict` (fit band, e.g. "strong fit"), and `rank_date` (ISO date of ranking). The `status` field is set to `"ranked"`. Do not drop any of these fields when re-writing entries.

2. Only present jobs NOT already in the seen list or tracker.

### Step 4.5: Generate Referral Contact Links (High & Medium Fit Only)

For every job from this run with `fit` of **high** or **medium** (skip low-fit jobs),
build two LinkedIn people-search URLs so the user can find a recruiter or team member to
reach out to for a referral or a warm intro. This is deliberately a link-generation step,
not an automated lookup: no scraping, no third-party API, zero runtime dependencies or
credentials required.

**A. Recruiters / Talent Acquisition (the referral path)**
```
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=<url-encoded "<Company Name> recruiter">&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER
```

**B. Role/team peers (informational-outreach / warm-intro path)**
```
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=<url-encoded "<Company Name> <role keyword>">&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER
```
Use a short keyword drawn from the posting's title for `<role keyword>` - e.g. a posting
titled "AI Program Manager" becomes `"<Company Name> AI Program Manager"`.

Both links are for the user to open and browse themselves - never fetch or scrape the
LinkedIn people-search result pages programmatically. Never fabricate contacts or claim a
specific person was found; these are search links, not results.

### Step 5: Present Results

Present new jobs in a table sorted by fit (high first). When Step 1b skipped
portals (`enabled: false`), report them with the `skipped (disabled):` line below
so opting one out stays visible rather than silent; omit the line when nothing
was skipped.

```
## New Job Matches - YYYY-MM-DD

Found X new positions (Y high, Z medium, W low match).

skipped (disabled): <portal-name>, <portal-name>

| # | Fit | Title | Company | Location | Deadline | URL |
|---|-----|-------|---------|----------|----------|-----|
| 1 | High | ... | ... | ... | ... | [Link](...) |

### High-Match Highlights
For each high-match job, add 2-3 bullet points:
- Why it matches your profile
- Key requirements to check
- Any red flags

### Contacts
For each high/medium-fit job from Step 4.5, add a short contacts block with the two
LinkedIn search links:
- Recruiters/TA search link, for the referral path
- Role/team-peer search link, for the warm-intro / informational-outreach path
```

After presenting, ask:
> "Want me to evaluate any of these in detail? Just give me the number(s)."

If the user picks a number, invoke the **job-application-assistant** skill workflow (fit evaluation first, then CV + cover letter if approved).

If the run found many new jobs (roughly 8+), also suggest `/rank` - it batch-scores all new postings against the full fit framework and returns a ranked shortlist, which beats eyeballing a long table. (`/rank` sets the `ranked` and `expired` status values in `seen_jobs.json`; treat both as already-seen for dedup purposes.)

### Step 6: Update Tracker (Optional)

If the user decides to apply to any job, add a row to `job_search_tracker.csv`.

## Important Rules

1. **Never fabricate job postings.** Only present jobs from actual CLI search/detail output or WebSearch/WebFetch results.
2. **Respect deduplication.** Always check seen_jobs.json AND job_search_tracker.csv before presenting.
3. **Focus on configured geographic area.** Skip jobs that require relocation or are clearly outside commute range.
4. **Only open positions.** Skip postings with expired deadlines or those marked as closed.
5. **Be efficient with detail fetches.** Don't run `detail` or WebFetch on every search hit — pre-filter by title/snippet, then fetch only promising matches.
6. **Parallel searches.** Run portal CLI searches in parallel; use WebSearch only for gaps the CLIs don't cover.
7. **No automated people lookups.** Referral contacts (Step 4.5) are LinkedIn search links only - never fetch or scrape LinkedIn people-search result pages programmatically.
